        Appeal
      </h2>
      <p className="paragraph-8">
        During the Great Recession, a hotelier purchased a property for around
        $17M. The Assessorâ€™s office, however, assessed the property at double
        the purchase price, severely hampering the hotel&#x27;s cash flow and
        profitability. SF Tax Appeal was enlisted as the agent and successfully
        negotiated tax refunds amounting to approximately $575,000 for the
        hotelier.

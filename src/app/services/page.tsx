                <strong>Supplemental &amp; Base Year Appeals Services</strong>
              </h1>
              <p>
                In today&#x27;s San Francisco real estate tax landscape, many
                homeowners often find discrepancies between their
                property&#x27;s assessed value on their property tax bill and
                the purchase price they paid. If you&#x27;re among the
                homeowners who notice that your assessed value, particularly on
                the secured property tax bill, is higher than the sales price,
                SF Tax Appeal is here to assist. Get in touch with us at (628)
                333-9492 to initiate a supplemental appeal. It&#x27;s essential
                to act swiftly, especially within the vital 60-day window
                following the supplemental notice. Our expertise lies in
                ensuring that you garner the maximum possible refunds.
                Furthermore, for those unaware, a base year appeal can be lodged
                within a span of four years, offering a significant opportunity
                to reduce your property taxes throughout the duration of your
                ownership.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our proficiency extends beyond just contesting overvaluations by
                the county assessor&#x27;s office. At SF Tax Appeal, we pride
                ourselves on our acumen in pinpointing and rectifying valuation
                disputes and taxation anomalies, especially those stemming from
                property transfers or new construction. The goal of a fruitful
                appeal is to realign the assessed value of taxable property with
                the property&#x27;s fair market value, securing consistent
                property tax savings for you as the owner.
                <br />
                <br />
                Understanding the intricacies and enduring benefits of our
                services, our pricing model is transparent and fair. For this
                type of appeal, SF Tax Appeal levies a charge equivalent to 60%
                of the first year&#x27;s tax savings. What sets us apart is our
                commitment to our clients; any subsequent reductions stemming
                from a successful appeal don&#x27;t carry additional charges.
                This stands in stark contrast to some competitors in the market
                who might impose fees amounting to a staggering 100% of the
                first year’s savings.

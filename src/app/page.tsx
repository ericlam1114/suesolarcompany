            <p className="paragraph-2">
              One of the primary benefits of QSBS is the ability to exclude up
              to 100% of capital gains from federal income taxes on the sale of
              the stock, subject to certain limits. This exclusion is capped at
              the greater of $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer's basis in the
              stock.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) provision, outlined in
              Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, presents a significant
              tax incentive for investors in small businesses, particularly
              through the capital gains tax exclusion. The primary attraction of
              QSBS is the potential to exclude up to 100% of capital gains from
              federal income taxes when the stock is sold, provided certain
              conditions are met. This exclusion is subject to a cap, which is
              the greater of $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer's basis in the
              stock. For example, if an investor's initial investment (basis) in
              the stock is $1 million, they could potentially exclude up to $10
              million in gains from their taxable income.

            <h2 className="heading-2">Deferral of Capital Gains</h2>
            <p className="paragraph-2">
              Investors may also defer capital gains taxes by reinvesting their
              gains from the sale of QSBS into another QSBS within 60 days. This
              allows for the postponement of tax payments and can help in
              managing cash flows.
              <br />
              <br />
              The provision for deferring capital gains taxes through
              reinvestment in Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) offers an
              additional financial advantage for investors. Under Section 1045
              of the Internal Revenue Code, if an investor sells QSBS and
              reinvests the gains into another QSBS within a 60-day period, they
              can defer capital gains taxes that would otherwise be due on the
              sale. This aspect of the tax code is particularly beneficial for
              investors looking to continuously invest in small, innovative
              companies while managing their tax liabilities more effectively.

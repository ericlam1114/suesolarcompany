                    Jon Morgan, CEO of Skyline Tax Appeal, began his real estate
                    career in 2005, guided by his grandfather, Martin. <br />
                    <br />
                    His work has brought him face-to-face with intricate,
                    challenging properties spanning across the United States. A
                    highlight was his work on a monumental 800,000 square foot
                    office building nestled in the heart of San Francisco. This
                    endeavor, among others, underscored Jon&#x27;s unique
                    ability to handle complex property tax issues while
                    demonstrating his comprehensive understanding of commercial
                    property valuation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Jon&#x27;s extensive knowledge of real estate tax
                    law and his transition from appraiser to tax appeal
                    consultant have led to a 98% success rate in appeals. <br />
                    <br />A proud UCSF alumnus, Jon enjoys family time and
                    outdoor activities like softball.

                    His ability to pinpoint gaps in the market has always been
                    one of his strong suits. Eric, in partnership with Jon, took
                    the initiative to establish Skyline Tax Appeal. This venture was
                    specifically created to guide and support property owners
                    who may find themselves at a disadvantage due to a lack of
                    understanding of the intricacies involved in commercial
                    property tax appeals.

                    His dedication to the realm of real estate is not just
                    professional but is rooted deeply in his family&#x27;s
                    legacy. Eric&#x27;s grandfather cofounded Lam &amp;

                    Pennsylvania, and following in the family tradition his
